                                LIVING SACRIFICE AND THE ALTAR


                                Hey there! My name is Gauri, I’m very excited to share my first blog on my website page. I’m so sure you’re gonna love it. There are many things, incidents or people in our lives for sure, by which we indivisual learns a lot and add value in our lives. Here I would be sharing some of the most important values that every other person in the world covets. My blogs can be based on very simple examples to really high value attached examples, which anyone and everyone can relate to. Past few weeks back I learnt about some really power revelation of “Living Sacrifice and The Altar”.
                                 In simple language “HOW A DISCIPLINED LIFE LEADS TO THE ETERNLE DELIGHT” for which whole world run towards.
                                Let’s start to go to find the deeper knowledge about it. The first word I’ll take is ALTAR then LIVING SACRIFICE and then PRIEST and their meaning or what they presents. 
                                1 Altar- The place designed to build a personal or intimate relationship with God.
                                2 Sacrifice- Our living bodies, bringing it to the altar INTENSIONALLY ( kind of discipline ).
                                3 Priest- The person who used to be the mediator between men and God,and used to offer Sacrifices on the altar behalf of people’s sins.
                                So these were the instructions were given to a priest by God in the ancient times that FIRE should always be burning on the altar, and keep fire burning on the altar he had to put WOOD continually.   
                                So the ancient scene is to keep ourselves pure and presentable before God, the chosen priest by God had to do it for the people. And it was priest’s duty to keep the Fire burning on the altar. By doing this God used to forgive their sins,and that fire used to sent by God ,which used to consume the sacrifice, meaning that offering is accepted by the Lord.
                                Now we know how it used to be before Christ, But in new era ( after Christ ) it has different revelation of the ALTAR,SACRIFICE (LIVING),PRIEST,FIRE and WOOD. Although its very old tradition kind of thing but it has very significant value attached to it. Now we don’t do exactly all thing old way but new way. 
                                Let’s understand it how? In new time means after Christ all these things represents same value but different objects with the same meaning, like 3 of them I have already explained now 
                                Fire - Holy Spirit, that baptized us with heavenly fire.
                                Wood- Our Prayer life, which has to be consistent. 
                                
                                In new covenant The altar is our heart, where we sit in the presence of God and talk to Him, we consider that time to be sacred/holy, which means that particular time you can not give to others. This is the time dedicated to the Lord, and Him alone this is a sacrifice,  that we bring our body under divine presence.
                                In new era the altar is broken which means they live in broken fellowship with the Father. In old times we used to have priest to offer our prayers or sacrifices before the Lord but in new covenant We are the Priest and We are the sacrifice, and when we repair our altar ( heart means our relationship ) with God, then Holy Spirit shows up on the sacrifice, in result we experience current like vibration or heat in the body or we start speaking in tongues. Such experiences are so anointed and powerful, God also bless us with many gifts during this time.
                                I wanna share that people in the world runs after so many things that may keep them content in their spirit or happy or blessed but they often doesn’t understand that all those things demands our purity, again its not about you are dirty, but the world we live in has contamination all around and we sometimes get effected by them and also forget to God,or coming to the altar. Altar is the sign of our purification, In Christ we’re washed and cleansed but to maintain that purity we’ve to come again and again to the altar where Fire of God comes down and purifies us completely our body,soul,heart intentions, thoughts, motives or anything that need purification, that fire burns and fills us with heavenly things in those areas. And for this we need to keep coming back to the altar. In Christ we’re washed once for all but its our responsibility to maintain our purity and righteousness. Whatever I have shred is not about how to become pure or religious, but about how only by restoring our relationship with our father can help us to live healthy,pure and righteous even though we live in the world full of corruption. We live with the reality and freedom of heaven. It’s the matter of our hearts, God’s love is forever same either you come to him to restore your relationship with Him or not, He always waiting and ready to give us live that we long for. And its not God gives but He has already provided us all things in His Son Jesus, now it’s a principle that whenever we go to Him, Those things runs after us. God is a loving father and He will remain same but question is do we allow His love into our lives, and grow in deep intimate relationship with Him or just want to ignore or take His love,grace and mercy for granted as usual? Nobody wants to live in broken fellowship with the father, but we need to discipline and make a habit to keep coming to Him not for the things to get. But COME TO HIM FOR HIM, this is the key to win the real lover of your life. And when we love somebody how do you understand that you love or somebody loves you? YOU GIVE ( time, energy, will, heart, intentions,gift etc) you love to pour out your best in that person. In a same way, Father has done and keep doing it for us NOW its our time to show Him our love by GIVING OUR BEST TO GOD.
